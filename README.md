# The Forgotten Playground
Welcome to the forgotten playground. This is the space where we can mess with ideas and learn the Godot game engine within the context of a Hollow Knight clone. Join us in our experiments!

If this is your first time contributing to a Whapper Studios project, check out our [Technical Documentation](https://github.com/whapper-studios/.github-private/tree/main/docs) for coding guidelines!

If this is your first time using C# with Godot, we recommend following the [Local Dev Setup Guide](https://github.com/whapper-studios/.github-private/blob/main/docs/guides/local-dev-setup.md) to configure using VSCode for C# development
